# AI-Powered Sentiment Analysis – Ventures Adventures Hackathon

## Overview

This project was developed during the *Ventures Adventures* entrepreneurship hackathon.  
The objective was to design an AI-driven solution capable of extracting meaningful insights from large volumes of textual data.

The system leverages **RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach)**, a transformer-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) model, to analyze and classify sentiment from text sources.

## Problem Statement

Organizations often struggle to interpret large datasets such as:

- Customer reviews  
- Social media comments  
- Public feedback  
- Institutional evaluations  

Manually analyzing this data is inefficient and time-consuming. This project aims to automate sentiment detection and provide structured insights to support decision-making.

## Approach

- Text preprocessing and cleaning  
- Fine-tuning / using a pre-trained RoBERTa model  
- Sentiment classification (positive, negative, neutral)  
- Performance evaluation using standard NLP metrics  

## Applications

The solution can be applied to:

- Product sentiment analysis  
- Institutional reputation monitoring  
- Brand perception analysis  
- Public opinion tracking  

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- PyTorch  
- Transformers (HuggingFace)  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn

This project combines artificial intelligence and entrepreneurship by transforming unstructured textual data into actionable insights.
